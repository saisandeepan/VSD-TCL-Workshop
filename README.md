# VSD-TCL-Workshop

This repository contains my learnings from the TCL programming workshop conducted by VLSI System Design.

The aim of the workshop is to create a TCL script that processes the files with the synthesis collaterals of a design and gives us the prelayout timing results as output.

Below is the csv file that contains the paths to the input files needed for synthesis
